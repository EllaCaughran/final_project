```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

maybe I need to make a function of how each variable changes over time????
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

lowfat_dehydration <- read.csv("lowfat_dehydration_rep2.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

View(lowfat_dehydration)

```

```{r cleaning data, include=FALSE}


```

```{r creating plots of variables over time, include=FALSE}




activity_plot <- ggplot(data = lowfat_dehydration, aes(x = time, y = Activity, color = Animal_ID)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = 'top') + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Activity")

activity_trend <- activity_plot + stat_smooth()

```
